# Jembi Openhim Docker Repository

The Dockerfiles for [Openhim](http://openhim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [Core](https://github.com/jembi/openhim-core-js) and [Console](https://github.com/jembi/openhim-console).

These Dockerfiles are used to manage the docker images for releases of each Openhim repository.

We use two branches to track the two sets of files:

* [Console Dockerfiles](https://github.com/jembi/openhim-docker/tree/console)
